Plugin for IntelliJ IDEA that adds ability to generate builder for a class and switch between them.
Switching between builder and source class is similar to 'Go To Test' action.
Generated builder class does not use reflection, only setter methods or constructor.
Requires gradle and IntelliJ IDEA for building.
Build instructions:
- edit build.gradle and change values of 'ideaInstallationPath' and 'ideaJdk' to be in sync with your environment
- edit build.gradle and change "from('/META-INF')" to "from('./META-INF')" if using linux as dev environment
- invoke 'gradle build' from command line to build
- invoke 'gradle idea' from command line to generate IDEA specific files - provides possibility to be opened as IDEA project (open builder-generator-idea-plugin.ipr)
